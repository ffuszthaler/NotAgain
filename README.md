## _Physics ideas_:

- Ricochet Bullets
- Drag on certain grounds
- Decelerating bullets (air resistance), decreasing value = air resistance = bullet velocity

</br>

## _To Do_:

- PHYSICS PART! (mandatory)
- 1min timer once you hit a certain score
- UI (health bar, 1min timer, player score/kills, press e to call reinforcements)
- Main Menu, End screen showing score using HTML, CSS
- everything else I forgot
