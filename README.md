## _Physics ideas_:

- Ricochet Bullets
- Drag on certain grounds
- Decelerating bullets (air resistance), decreasing value = air resistance = bullet velocity

</br>

## _To Do_:

- add bool flag to mouse rotation mechanic in SpriteMap.js, so it can be turned off for enemies
- collision detection between all enemies and player (bullet hit detection)
- make enemies look almost the same but have a dark red be the dominant clothing color
